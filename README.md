# AoE2DE-Playercolor-Generator

This python project generates a playercolor.pal file from a given color value.
The generated .pal files go in AoE2DE/resources/_common/palettes.

The main version in the "AoE Palette Generator" folder generates .pal files in the same way the default colors were generated, by linear interpolation.

There's also a non-linear version which in actuality just uses two linear interpolations instead of one. This creates a more vibrant look that makes the players easier to distinguish in-game.

The project was created in Visual Studio, so I recommend using VS to run it.

Feel free to upload any mods facilitated by this project on the official AoE2 DE mod forum or wherever you'd like.
